# TREND ANALYSIS ON  DRUG-RELATED APPREHENSIONS IN VIOLATION OF RA 9165 USING INTEGER-VALUED TRANSFER FUNCTION MODELS: A CASE STUDY USING DIPOLOG CITY DATA

This repository contains R scripts used in the thesis:

"TREND ANALYSIS ON  DRUG-RELATED APPREHENSIONS IN VIOLATION OF RA 9165 
USING INTEGER-VALUED TRANSFER FUNCTION MODELS: A CASE STUDY USING DIPOLOG CITY DATA"

## Description
The codes implement Bayesian integer-valued transfer function models
using Generalized Poisson (GP) and Negative Binomial (NB) distributions.
The models are applied to monthly apprehension count data related to
violations of RA 9165 in Dipolog City.

## Contents
- R scripts for GP-TFM1, GP-TFM2, NB-TFM1, and NB-TFM2 models
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis scripts
- Model diagnostics and posterior analysis

## Software
All analyses were conducted using R and RStudio.
